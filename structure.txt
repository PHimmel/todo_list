How should this be ordered?

1. Prompt for user input to add data:

    input should be time and activity
    input is verified
    input is stored in an external file

2. Prompt for user to remove current data:
    enter time and activity to be deleted
    input is verified
    input is removed from external file

2. Display current data
    List all items and their times from the external file



1 + 2 commonalities:
    Prompt for input
    input verification

1 + 2 + 3 commonalities:
    external file is accessed

Maybe add Tkinter gui to it
Else it is only for command line/ boring and plain

Tkinter:
Make main window
put main menu in it
with buttons for 4 options ---> new file, list all, add, delete
make 4 new corresponding windows, with option to return to main window

Add text fields for add/delete options
